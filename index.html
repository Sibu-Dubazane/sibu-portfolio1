            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>With over +5 years of hands-on experience in IT support and technical operations, I bring a strong
                foundation in end-user support, system administration, and project coordination. My career began at DXC
                Technology as a Technical Intern, where I gained core skills in troubleshooting, Active Directory, and
                network support. I then advanced into desktop and infrastructure support roles with Ulwembu Business
                Services and Mpilo Technologies, both through MSP engagements, where I provided hybrid & remote support,
                managed cloud platforms, enforced security policies, and led small-scale IT projects. I also served as
                Founder & Technical Operations Lead at Soweto Luxe Interiors, blending my IT
                expertise with entrepreneurial leadership. I managed the business’s technical environment—including
                cloud services, compliance, and IT systems—while also overseeing day-to-day operations, client
                management, and process optimization.</p>
            <p>Today, I'm proud to serve as a Technical Support Specialist at PulsateHQ, where I provide high-level
                support to clients, ensure system efficiency, and contribute to continuous improvement in a fast-paced,
                customer-focused environment.</p>
            <p>I'm driven by a desire to make technology simpler and more accessible — whether that's through backend
                systems, user support, or infrastructure projects.</p>

            <h2>My Startup Story</h2>
            <p>
                As the tech-minded founder of <strong>Soweto Luxe Interiors</strong>, I helped turn a shared passion for
                improving everyday spaces into a purpose-driven business. What began informally with small local
                projects quickly grew through word of mouth and genuine demand. I took charge of the digital backbone —
                building our website, setting up automation, and ensuring our systems run smoothly so we can focus on
                what matters: delivering functional, beautiful spaces backed by efficient, reliable tech & business
                operations.
